# Hyper-V Scripts

This is a fork of the now unmaintained scripts from
[microsoft/linux-vm-tools](https://github.com/microsoft/linux-vm-tools). I have
removed the Arch settings because I can't maintain it.

If this script helps you, please give a +1 at the StackOverflow issue that
started it: https://askubuntu.com/a/1061853/832580

Please note that Microsoft claims this is ready, and you might not need this
repo. Check out 
[their blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2018/09/17/run-ubuntu-virtual-machines-made-even-easier-with-hyper-v-quick-create/).
You could you the 
[Hyper-V Quick Create feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine).
